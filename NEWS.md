v1.2.0, TBD
=======================

## General notes

- Added GNI provider
- Added PSM2 provider

## GNI provider notes
- Initial release

## PSM provider notes
- General bug fixes
- Support auto progress mode
- Support more threading modes
- Only set FI_CONTEXT mode if FI_TAGGED or FI_MSG is used
- Support Intel Omni-Path Fabric via the psm2-compat library

## PSM2 provider notes
- Initial addition

## Sockets provider notes

- General bug fixes and code cleanup
- Increase buffered receive limit
- Ignore FI_INJECT flag for atomic read operation
- Return -FI_EINVAL instead of -FI_ENODATA for fi_endpoint for invalid attributes
- Set default tag format to FI_TAG_GENERIC
- Set src/dest iov len correctly for readv operations
- Fix random crashes while closing shared contexts
- Fix an out of bound access when large multi-recv limit is specified by user
- Reset tag field in CQ entry for send completion
- Do not set prov_name in fabric_attr
- Validate flags in CQ/Cntr bind operations
- Scalability enhancements
- Increase mr_key size to 64 bit
- Use red-black tree for mr_key lookup

## usNIC provider notes
- The usNIC provider does not yet support asynchronous memory registration.
  Return -FI_EOPNOTSUPP if an event queue is bound to a domain with FI_REG_MR.
- Set fi_usnic_info::ui_version correctly in calls to
  fi_usnic_ops_fabric::getinfo().
- Improve fi_cq_sread performance.
- Return -FI_EINVAL from av_open when given invalid paramters.
- Fix bug in fi_av_remove that could lead to a seg fault.
- Implement fi_av_insertsvc.
- Report FI_PROTO_RUDP as protocol for EP_RDM.

## Verbs provider notes

- Add support for RDM EPs. Currently only FI_TAGGED capability is supported.
  RDM and MSG EPs would be reported in seperate domains since they don't share
  CQs. The RDM enpoint feature is currently experimental and no guarantees are
  given with regard to its functionality.
- Refactor the code into several files to enable adding RDM support.
- Consolidate send code paths to improve maintainability.
- Fix a bug in fi_getinfo where wild card address was not used when service
  argument is given.
- Fix fi_getinfo to always return -FI_ENODATA in case of failure.
- Add support for fi_eq_write.
- Other misc bug fixes.
