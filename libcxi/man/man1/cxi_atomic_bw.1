.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]cxi_atomic_bw\f[R] is a simple benchmark for measuring Atomic
Memory Operation (AMO) bandwidth.
It can be configured to run a number of iterations or to run for a
duration of time.
Bandwidth is measured for a specified atomic operation and atomic type.
Where possible, target writes are ensured to occur with every AMO.
Either bi-directional or uni-directional bandwidth can be measured.
.SS How to run
.PP
Two copies of the program must be launched.
The first copy is the server.
It accepts optional arguments to specify which CXI device to use and
which port to listen on for the client connection.
The second copy is the client.
It must be supplied with the hostname or IPv4 address of the server,
along with the port to connect to if the default value was not used.
The client must also be supplied with all desired run options.
.SS Output
.PP
Both the server and client print output, much of which is the same
between the two.
Once a connection has been established, a summary of the specified
options is printed along with the server and client NIC fabric
addresses.
After the benchmark runs, four columns of data are printed.
.TP
\f[I]AMO Size[B]\f[R]
The size of the AMOs.
.TP
\f[I]Ops\f[R]
The number of AMOs performed.
When measuring bi-directional bandwidth, the server and client only
report the number of AMOs they initiate, not the combined count.
.TP
\f[I]BW[MB/s]\f[R]
The measured bandwidth in megabytes per second.
When measuring bi-directional bandwidth, the server and client
bandwidths are combined and reported by both sides.
.TP
\f[I]OpRate[M/s]\f[R]
The measured AMO rate in millions of AMOs per second.
When measuring bi-directional bandwidth, the server and client AMO rates
are combined and reported by both sides.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\f[B]-d, --device\f[R]=\f[I]DEV\f[R]
The Cassini NIC device name to use.
When unspecified, \[dq]cxi0\[dq] is used.
.TP
\f[B]-v, --svc-id\f[R]=\f[I]SVC_ID\f[R]
The service ID to use.
This option will be used when running as a non-privileged user.
When unspecified the default service ID is used.
.TP
\f[B]-p, --port\f[R]=\f[I]PORT\f[R]
The TCP port number to use for the client/server connection.
When unspecified, port 49194 is used.
.TP
\f[B]-n, --iters\f[R]=\f[I]ITERS\f[R]
The number of iterations to perform.
A single iteration consists of sending \f[I]LIST_SIZE\f[R] AMOs and then
waiting for each to be acknowledged, or when using fetching AMOs, for
each response to be written to the initiator.
When \f[I]ITERS\f[R] and \f[I]DURATION\f[R] are both unspecified, 10000
iterations are performed.
.TP
\f[B]-D, --duration\f[R]=\f[I]DURATION\f[R]
This option configures the benchmark to continue running iterations
until \f[I]DURATION\f[R] seconds has elapsed.
.TP
\f[B]-l, --list-size\f[R]=\f[I]LIST_SIZE\f[R]
The number of AMOs performed per iteration.
The AMO commands are all added to the TX command queue before ringing
the queue\[cq]s doorbell to trigger the AMOs.
By default the list size is 4096.
.TP
\f[B]-A, --atomic-op\f[R]=\f[I]ATOMIC_OP\f[R]
The atomic operation to use.
When unspecified, SUM is used.
Supported ops are: MIN, MAX, SUM, LOR, LAND, BOR, BAND, LXOR, BXOR,
SWAP, CSWAP, and AXOR.
.TP
\f[B]-C, --cswap-op\f[R]=\f[I]CSWAP_OP\f[R]
The CSWAP operation to use when \f[I]ATOMIC_OP\f[R] is set to CSWAP.
When unspecified, EQ is used.
Supported ops are: EQ, NE, LE, LT, GE, and GT.
.TP
\f[B]-T, --atomic-type\f[R]=\f[I]ATOMIC_TYPE\f[R]
The atomic type to use.
When unspecified, UINT64 is used.
Supported types are: INT8, UINT8, INT16, UINT16, INT32, UINT32, INT64,
UINT64, FLOAT, DOUBLE, FLOAT_COMPLEX, DOUBLE_COMPLEX, and UINT128.
.TP
\f[B]-b, --bidirectional\f[R]
This option configures the benchmark to measure bi-directional
bandwidth.
The client and server calculate their individual rates, share these with
each other, and then both report the combined rates.
By default the benchmark performs AMOs from the client to the server
only.
In this case, the client rates are still shared and reported from both
client and server.
Running bi-directionally works best when combined with
\f[B]--duration\f[R] rather than \f[B]--iters\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]--fetching\f[R]
Use fetching AMOs.
By default non-fetching AMOs are used.
.TP
\f[B]--matching\f[R]
Use matching list entries at the target.
By default non-matching list entries are used.
.TP
\f[B]--unrestricted\f[R]
Use unrestricted AMOs.
By default restricted AMOs are used when non-matching list entries are
used at the target.
.TP
\f[B]--no-hrp\f[R]
Disable the use of High Rate Puts.
By default HRPs are used for restricted, non-fetching AMOs.
.TP
\f[B]--no-idc\f[R]
Disable the use of Immediate Data Commands.
By default IDCs are used when non-matching list entries are used at the
target.
.TP
\f[B]-h, --help\f[R]
Display the help text and exit.
.TP
\f[B]-V, --version\f[R]
Display the program version and exit.
