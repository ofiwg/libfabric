.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]cxi_read_bw\f[R] is a simple benchmark for measuring one-sided RDMA
read bandwidth.
It can be configured to run a number of iterations or to run for a
duration of time.
Bandwidth is measured for a specific size of reads, or for each size
within a range.
Either bi-directional or uni-directional bandwidth can be measured.
Users have the option to allocate source and destination buffers from
system memory or from an available GPU device via calls to the HIP,
CUDA, or INTEL Level-zero APIs.
.SS How to run
.PP
Two copies of the program must be launched.
The first copy is the server.
It accepts optional arguments to specify which CXI device to use, which
port to listen on for the client connection, and whether or not GPU
buffers should be used.
The second copy is the client.
It must be supplied with the hostname or IPv4 address of the server,
along with the port to connect to if the default value was not used.
The client must also be supplied with all desired run options.
.SS Output
.PP
Both the server and client print output, much of which is the same
between the two.
Once a connection has been established, a summary of the specified
options is printed along with the server and client NIC fabric
addresses.
After the benchmark runs (or after each run for a range of sizes), four
columns of data are printed.
.TP
\f[I]RDMA Size[B]\f[R]
The size of the RDMA reads.
.TP
\f[I]Reads\f[R]
The number of reads performed.
When measuring bi-directional bandwidth, the server and client only
report the number of reads they initiate, not the combined count.
.TP
\f[I]BW[MB/s]\f[R]
The measured bandwidth in megabytes per second.
When measuring bi-directional bandwidth, the server and client
bandwidths are combined and reported by both sides.
.TP
\f[I]PktRate[Mpkt/s]\f[R]
The measured packet rate in millions of packets per second.
When measuring bi-directional bandwidth, the server and client packet
rates are combined and reported by both sides.
Reads larger than the Portals MTU (2048 bytes) are split into multiple
packets.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\f[B]-d, --device\f[R]=\f[I]DEV\f[R]
The Cassini NIC device name to use.
When unspecified, \[dq]cxi0\[dq] is used.
.TP
\f[B]-v, --svc-id\f[R]=\f[I]SVC_ID\f[R]
The service ID to use.
This option will be used when running as a non-privileged user.
When unspecified the default service ID is used.
.TP
\f[B]-p, --port\f[R]=\f[I]PORT\f[R]
The TCP port number to use for the client/server connection.
When unspecified, port 49194 is used.
.TP
\f[B]-t, --tx-gpu\f[R]
The GPU to use for TX buffer allocation.
By default system memory is used.
.TP
\f[B]-r, --rx-gpu\f[R]
The GPU to use for RX buffer allocation.
By default system memory is used.
.TP
\f[B]-g, --gpu-type\f[R]
The GPU type to use with this test.
Valid values are AMD, NVIDIA, or INTEL.
By default the type is determined by discovered GPU files on the system.
.TP
\f[B]-n, --iters\f[R]=\f[I]ITERS\f[R]
The number of iterations to perform.
A single iteration consists of sending \f[I]LIST_SIZE\f[R] reads and
then waiting for each to be acknowledged.
When a range of read sizes is specified, \f[I]ITERS\f[R] iterations are
performed for each size.
When \f[I]ITERS\f[R] and \f[I]DURATION\f[R] are both unspecified, 1000
iterations are performed.
.TP
\f[B]-D, --duration\f[R]=\f[I]DURATION\f[R]
This option configures the benchmark to continue running iterations
until \f[I]DURATION\f[R] seconds has elapsed.
When a range of read sizes is specified, the benchmark runs for
\f[I]DURATION\f[R] seconds for each size.
.TP
\f[B]-s, --size\f[R]=\f[I]MIN\f[R][:\f[I]MAX\f[R]]
The read size, or range of sizes.
Valid read sizes are 1 through 4294697295 bytes (4GiB - 1).
When a range is specified, the benchmark runs once for each size that is
a power of two from \f[I]MIN\f[R] to \f[I]MAX\f[R].
By default the read size is 65536 bytes.
.TP
\f[B]-l, --list-size\f[R]=\f[I]LIST_SIZE\f[R]
The number of read performed per iteration.
The read commands are all added to the TX command queue before ringing
the queue\[cq]s doorbell to trigger the reads.
By default the list size is 256.
.TP
\f[B]-b, --bidirectional\f[R]
This option configures the benchmark measure bi-directional bandwidth.
The client and server calculate their individual rates, share these with
each other, and then both report the combined rates.
By default the benchmark performs reads from the client to the server
only.
In this case, the client rates are still shared and reported from both
client and server.
Running bi-directionally works best when combined with
\f[B]--duration\f[R] rather than \f[B]--iters\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]--unrestricted\f[R]
Use unrestricted reads.
By default restricted reads are used.
.TP
\f[B]--buf-sz\f[R]=\f[I]BUF_SIZE\f[R]
The maximum allowed data buffer size for both the transmit and target
buffers, specified in bytes.
The benchmark may allocate less space if it is possible to fit all
\f[I]LIST_SIZE\f[R] reads of a single iteration, without overlap,
aligned to \f[I]BUF_ALIGN\f[R] boundaries.
If \f[I]BUF_SIZE\f[R] is not a multiple of the page size, it is rounded
up to the nearest page boundary.
However, read offsets within the buffers are still chosen as if the
buffer is only \f[I]BUF_SIZE\f[R] bytes.
If the reads for a single iteration do not fit without overlap, their
offsets are wrapped around.
.TP
\f[B]--buf-align\f[R]=\f[I]BUF_ALIGN\f[R]
The alignment of reads in the transmit and target buffers.
By default this is 64 bytes.
.TP
\f[B]--use-hp\f[R]=\f[I]HP_SIZE\f[R]
The size of huge pages to use when allocating the transmit and target
buffers.
This option has no effect when GPU buffers are used.
Valid values are 2M and 1G.
By default huge pages are disabled.
.TP
\f[B]-h, --help\f[R]
Display the help text and exit.
.TP
\f[B]-V, --version\f[R]
Display the program version and exit.
