.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.SS "fi_cntr_open"
fi_cntr_open allocates a new fabric counter.  The properties and behavior of
the counter are defined by struct fi_cntr_attr.
.PP
.nf
struct fi_cntr_attr {
	int                  mask;      /* valid attr fields */
	enum fi_cntr_events  events;    /* type of events to count */
	enum fi_wait_obj     wait_obj;  /* requested wait object */
	struct fid_wait     *wait_set;  /* optional wait set */
	uint64_t             flags;     /* operation flags */
};
.fi
.IP "mask"
The mask field is used for forward and backward API compatibility.  It is
used by the application to indicate which fields in the attribute structure
have been set.  For this version of the API, mask should be set to
FI_CNTR_ATTR_MASK_V1, indicating that all specified fields have been initialized.
.IP "events"
A counter captures different types of events.  The specific type which is to
counted are one of the following:
.RS
.IP "FI_CNTR_EVENTS_COMP"
The counter increments for every successful completion that occurs on an
associated bound endpoint.  The type of completions -- sends and/or receives --
which are counted may be restricted using control flags when binding
the counter an the endpoint.  Counters increment on all successful completions,
separately from whether the operation generates an entry in an event queue.
.RE
.IP "wait_obj"
Counters may be associated with a specific wait object.  Wait objects allow
applications to block until the wait object is signaled, indicating that
a counter has reached a specific threshold.  Users may use fi_control to
retrieve the underlying wait object associated with a counter, in order to
use it in other system calls.  The following values may be used to specify
the type of wait object associated with a counter: FI_WAIT_NONE,
FI_WAIT_UNSPECIFIED, FI_WAIT_SET, FI_WAIT_FD, and FI_WAIT_MUT_COND.
.RS
.IP "FI_WAIT_NONE"
Used to indicate that the user will not block (wait) for events on the counter.
.IP "FI_WAIT_UNSPECIFIED"
Specifies that the user will only wait on the counter using fabric interface
calls, such as fi_cntr_readcond.  In this case, the underlying provider may
select the most appropriate or highest performing wait object available,
including custom wait mechanisms.  Applications that select
FI_WAIT_UNSPECIFIED are not guaranteed to retrieve the underlying wait
object.
.IP "FI_WAIT_SET"
Indicates that the event counter should use a wait set object to wait
for events.  If specified, the wait_set field must reference an existing
wait set object.
.IP "FI_WAIT_FD"
Indicates that the counter should use a file descriptor as its wait mechanism.
A file descriptor wait object must be usable in select, poll, and epoll
routines.  However, a provider may signal an FD wait object by marking it
as readable, writable, or with an error.
.IP "FI_WAIT_MUT_COND"
Specifies that the counter should use a pthread mutex and cond variable as a
wait object.
.RE
.IP "wait_set"
If wait_obj is FI_WAIT_SET, this field references a wait object to which the
event counter should attach.  When an event is added to the event counter,
the corresponding wait set will be signaled if all necessary conditions are
met.  The use of a wait_set enables an optimized method of waiting for events
across multiple event counters.  This field is ignored if wait_obj is not
FI_WAIT_SET.
.IP "flags"
Flags are reserved for future use, and must be set to 0.
.SS "fi_cntr_close"
The fi_cntr_close call releases all resources associated with a counter.
The counter must not be bound to any other resources prior to being freed.
.SS "fi_cntr_control"
The fi_cntr_control call is used to access provider or implementation specific
details of the counter.  Access to the counter should be serialized
across all calls when fi_cntr_control is invoked, as it may redirect the
implementation of counter operations.  The following control commands are usable
with a counter:
.IP "FI_GETOPSFLAG (uint64_t *)"
Returns the current default operational flags associated with the counter.
.IP "FI_SETOPSFLAG (uint64_t *)"
Modifies the current default operational flags associated with the counter.
Operational flags affected by fi_eq_control are: FI_AUTO_RESET.
.IP "FI_GETWAIT (void **)"
This command allows the user to retrieve the low-level wait object
associated with the counter.  The format of the wait-object is specified during
counter creation, through the counter attributes.  The fi_cntr_control arg
parameter should be an address where a pointer to the returned wait object
will be written.
.RS
.IP "FI_CNTR_WAIT_MUT_COND"
The counter wait is implemented using a pthread_mutex_t and pthread_cond_t.
FI_GETWAIT will return two pointers, a reference to pthread_mutex_t * and
pthread_cond_t *, respectively.
.RE
.SS "fi_cntr_read"
The fi_cntr_read call returns the current value of the counter.
.SS "fi_cntr_add"
This adds the user-specified value to the counter.
.SS "fi_cntr_set"
This sets the counter to the specified value.
.SS "fi_cntr_wait"
This call may be used to wait until the counter reaches the specified
threshold.  Upon successful return from this call, the counter will be
greater than or equal to the input threshold value.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
Returns 0 on success.  On error, a negative value corresponding to
fabric errno is returned.
.PP
fi_cntr_read
.RS
Returns the current value of the counter.
.RE
.PP
Fabric errno values are defined in
.IR "rdma/fi_errno.h".
