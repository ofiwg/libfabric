.IP "domain"
Fabric domain
.IP "cntr"

User specified context associated with the counter
.IP "value"
Value to increment or set counter

Value to compare counter against
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.SS "fi_cntr_open"
fi_cntr_open allocates a new fabric counter.  The properties and behavior of
the counter are defined by struct fi_cntr_attr.
.PP
.nf
struct fi_cntr_attr {
	int                  mask;      /* valid attr fields */
	enum fi_cntr_events  events;    /* type of events to count */
	enum fi_eq_wait_obj  wait_obj;  /* requested wait object */
	uint64_t             flags;     /* operation flags */
};
.fi
.IP "mask"
The mask field is used for forward and backward API compatibility.  It is
used by the application to indicate which fields in the attribute structure
have been set.  For this version of the API, mask should be set to
FI_CNTR_ATTR_MASK_V1, indicating that all specified fields have been initialized.
.IP "events"
A counter captures different types of events.  The specific type which is to
counted are one of the following:
.RS
.IP "FI_CNTR_EVENTS_COMP"
The counter increments for every successful completion that occurs on an
associated bound endpoint.  The type of completions -- sends and/or receives --
which are counted may be restricted using control flags when binding
the counter an the endpoint.  Counters increment on all successful completions,
separately from whether the operation generates an entry in an event queue.
.RE
.IP "wait_obj"
Counters may be associated with a specific wait object.  Wait objects allow
applications to block until the wait object is signaled, indicating that
a counter has reached a specific threshold.  Users may use fi_control to
retrieve the underlying wait object associated with a counter, in order to
use it in other system calls.  The following values may be used to specify
the type of wait object associated with a counter: FI_CNTR_WAIT_NONE and
FI_CNTR_WAIT_MUT_COND.
.IP "flags"
Flags that set the default operation of the counter.
.RS
.IP "FI_SEND"
Specifies that the counter will be used to count complete send operations.
Sends include message sends, RMA, and atomic write operations.  This
flag will automatically be used when binding the counter to an endpoint.
.IP "FI_RECV"
Specifies that the counter will be used to count complete receive operations.
This flag will automatically be used when binding the counter to an endpoint.
.RE
.SS "fi_cntr_close"
The fi_cntr_close call releases all resources associated with a counter.
The counter must not be bound to any other resources prior to being freed.
.SS "fi_cntr_control"
The fi_cntr_control call is used to access provider or implementation specific
details of the counter.  Access to the counter should be serialized
across all calls when fi_cntr_control is invoked, as it may redirect the
implementation of counter operations.  The following control commands are usable
with a counter:
.IP "FI_GETOPSFLAG (uint64_t *)"
Returns the current default operational flags associated with the counter.
.IP "FI_SETOPSFLAG (uint64_t *)"
Modifies the current default operational flags associated with the counter.
Operational flags affected by fi_eq_control are: FI_AUTO_RESET.
.IP "FI_GETWAIT (void **)"
This command allows the user to retrieve the low-level wait object
associated with the counter.  The format of the wait-object is specified during
counter creation, through the counter attributes.  The fi_cntr_control arg
parameter should be an address where a pointer to the returned wait object
will be written.
.RS
.IP "FI_CNTR_WAIT_MUT_COND"
The counter wait is implemented using a pthread_mutex_t and pthread_cond_t.
FI_GETWAIT will return two pointers, a reference to pthread_mutex_t * and
pthread_cond_t *, respectively.
.RE
.SS "fi_cntr_read"
The fi_cntr_read call returns the current value of the counter.
.SS "fi_cntr_add"
This adds the user-specified value to the counter.
.SS "fi_cntr_set"
This sets the counter to the specified value.
.SS "fi_cntr_wait"
This call may be used to wait until the counter reaches the specified
threshold.  Upon successful return from this call, the counter will be
greater than or equal to the input threshold value.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
Returns 0 on success.  On error, a negative value corresponding to
fabric errno is returned.
.PP
fi_cntr_read
.RS
Returns the current value of the counter.
.RE
.PP
Fabric errno values are defined in
.IR "rdma/fi_errno.h".
