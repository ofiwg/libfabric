.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Endpoints are transport level communication portals.  There are two types
of endpoints: active and passive.  Passive endpoints belong to a fabric
domain and are used to listen for incoming connection requests.  Active
endpoints belong to access domains and can perform data transfers.
.PP
Data transfer interfaces are bound to active endpoints.  Active endpoints
may be connection-oriented or connectionless, and may provide data
reliability.
.PP
Active endpoints are created in the disabled state.  They must transition into
an enabled state before being used to connect to a remote destination
or transfer data.  The fi_enable call is used to transition an endpoint into
an active state.
.PP
In order to transition an endpoint into an enabled state, it must be
bound to one or more fabric resources.  An endpoint that
will generate asynchronous events, either through data transfer operations
or communication establishment events, must be bound to the appropriate
event collectors before being enabled.
.PP
Once an endpoint has been activated, it may be associated with memory
regions and address vectors.  Receive buffers may be posted to it, and
calls may be made to connection establishment routines.
Connectionless endpoints may also perform data transfers. 
.PP
The behavior of an endpoint may be adjusted by setting its control
data and protocol options.  This allows the underlying provider to
redirect function calls to implementations optimized to meet the
desired application behavior.
.SS "fi_endpoint"
fi_endpoint allocates a new active endpoint.  The properties and behavior
of the endpoint are defined based on the provided struct fi_info.  See
fi_getinfo for additional details on fi_info.  fi_info flags that control
the operation of an endpoint are defined below.
.SS "fi_pendpoint"
Allocates a new passive endpoint with basic properties defined by struct
fi_info.
.SS "fi_close"
Closes an endpoint and release all resources associated with it.
.SS "fi_ep_bind"
fi_ep_bind is used to associate an endpoint with hardware resources.
The common use of fi_ep_bind is to direct asynchronous operations
associated with an endpoint to an event queue.  An endpoint must be
bound with ECs capable of reporting completions for any asynchronous
operation initiated on the endpoint.  For connection-oriented
endpoints, this requires binding the endpoint with an EC that supports
the communication management (CM) domain.
.PP
An active endpoint may direct asynchronous completions to different ECs, based
on the type of operation.  This is specified using fi_ep_bind flags.  The
following flags may be used separately or OR'ed together when binding
an endpoint to a completion domain EC.
.RS
.IP "FI_SEND"
Directs the completion of outbound data transfer requests to the
specified event queue.  This includes send message, RMA, and atomic
operations.
.IP "FI_RECV"  
Directs the notification of inbound data transfers to the
specified event queue.  This includes received messages.
.RE
.PP
Active endpoints that are configured to use index based addressing --
FI_ADDR_INDEX -- must be bound to a single AV.  AV binding can occur
before or after an endpoint has been enabled.
.SS "fi_enable"
This call transitions the endpoint into an enabled state.  An endpoint
must be enabled before it may be used to perform data transfers.
Enabling an endpoint typically results in hardware resources being
assigned to it.
.PP
Calling connect or accept on an endpoint will implicitly enable an
endpoint if it has not already been enabled. 
.SS "fi_cancel"
fi_cancel attempts to cancel an outstanding asynchronous operation.
The endpoint must have been configured to support cancelable operations,
or the operation itself must have been marked as cancelable in order
for this call to succeed.  Canceling an operation causes the fabric
provider to search for the operation and, if it is still pending, complete
it immediately as having been canceled.
.PP
Use of the fi_cancel call is paired with the FI_CANCEL flag.  Operations
which are cancelable must use struct fi_context as their user context. 
For performance reasons, this structure must be allocated by the user,
but may be used by the fabric provider to track the operation.  Typically,
users embed struct fi_context within their own context structure.
The struct fi_context must remain valid until the corresponding operation
completes or is successfully canceled.  Users should not update or interpret
the fields in this structure.  The structure is specified in
<rdma/fabric.h>.
.SS "fi_ep_control"
The control operation is used to adjust the default behavior of an
endpoint.  It allows the underlying provider to redirect function
calls to implementations optimized to meet the desired application
behavior.  As a result, calls to fi_ep_control must be serialized
against all other calls to an endpoint.
.PP
The base operation of an endpoint is selected during creation using
struct fi_info.  The following control commands and arguments may be
assigned to an endpoint.
.IP "FI_GETOPSFLAG -- uint64_t *flags"
Used to retrieve the current value of flags associated with data transfer
operations initiated on the endpoint.  See below for a list of control
flags.
.IP "FI_SETOPSFLAG -- uint64_t *flags"
Used to change the data transfer operation flags associated with an
endpoint. Valid control flags are defined below.
.SS "fi_getopt / fi_setopt"
Endpoint protocol operations may be retrieved using fi_getopt or set
using fi_setopt.  Applications specify the level that a desired option
exists, identify the option, and provide input/output buffers to
get or set the option.  fi_setopt provides an application a way to
adjust low-level protocol and implementation specific details of an
endpoint.
.PP
The following option levels and option names and parameters are defined.
.IP "FI_OPT_ENDPOINT"
.RS
.IP "FI_OPT_MAX_BUFFERED_SEND - size_t"
Defines the maximum buffered send operation (see the FI_BUFFERED_SEND
flag) that the endpoint currently supports.
.RE
.SH "CONTROL FLAGS"
The following flags may be set to control the operation of data transfers
initiated on an endpoint.  See fi_getinfo for additional descriptions of
the flags.
.IP "FI_BUFFERED_SEND"
Indicates that all outbound data buffer should be returned to the user's
control immediately after a data transfer call returns, even if the
operation is handled asynchronously.  This may require that the
provider copy the data into a local buffer and transfer out of that buffer.
.IP "FI_NOCOMP"
Indicates that the endpoint should, by default, not generate completion
entries for any data transfer operations.
.IP "FI_SIGNAL"
Indicates that the endpoint should, by default, generate completion
entries for data transfer operations.
.IP "FI_ACK"
Indicates that a completion event, when requested, should not be generated
until the operation has been acknowledged by the remote side.
.IP "FI_CANCEL"
Indicates that the user wants the ability to cancel all data transfer
operations.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns 0 on success. On error, a negative value corresponding to fabric
errno is returned. Fabric errno values are defined in 
.IR "rdma/fi_errno.h".
.SH "NOTES"
Users should call fi_close to release all resources allocated to the fabric
endpoint.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
Returns 0 on success.  On error, a negative value corresponding to
fabric errno is returned.
.PP
Fabric errno values are defined in
.IR "rdma/fi_errno.h".
.SH "ERRORS"
.IP "-FI_EDOMAIN"
A resource domain was not bound to the endpoint or an attempt was made to
bind multiple domains.
.IP "-FI_ENOEC"
The endpoint has not been configured with necessary event collectors.
.IP "FI_EOPBADSTATE"
The endpoint's state does not permit the requested operation.
