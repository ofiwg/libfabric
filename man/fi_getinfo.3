.SH NAME
fi_getinfo / fi_freeinfo \- Obtain / free fabric interface information
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "#include <rdma/fabric.h>"
.HP
.BI "int fi_getinfo(int " version ", const char *" node ", const char *" service ","
.BI "uint64_t " flags ", struct fi_info *" hints ", struct fi_info **" info ");"
.HP
.BI "int fi_freeinfo(struct fi_info *" info ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "version"
Interface version requested by application.
.IP "node"
Optional, name or fabric address to resolve.
.IP "service"
Optional, service name or port number of address.
.IP "flags"
Operation flags for the fi_getinfo call.
.IP "hints"
Reference to an fi_info structure that specifies criteria for selecting
the returned fabric information.
.IP "info"
A pointer to a linked list of fi_info structures containing response
information.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns information about available fabric services for reaching the specified
node or service, subject to any provided hints.  Callers must provide at least
one of the node, service, or hints parameters.  If no matching fabric information
is available, info will be set to NULL.
.PP
Based on the input hints, node, and service parameters, a list of fabric
domains and endpoints will be returned.  Each fi_info structure will describe
an endpoint that meets the application's specified communication criteria.
Each endpoint will be associated with a domain.  Applications can restrict
the number of returned endpoints by including additional criteria in their
search hints.  Relaxing or eliminating input hints will increase the number
and type of endpoints that are available.  Providers that return multiple
endpoints to a single fi_getinfo call should return the endpoints that are
highest performing.  Providers may indicate that an endpoint and domain
can support additional capabilities than those requested by the user only
if such support will not adversely affect performance.
.PP
The version parameter is used by the application to request the desired
version of the interfaces.  The version determines the format of all data
structures used by any of the fabric interfaces.  Applications should use the
FI_VERSION(major, minor) macro to indicate the version, with hard-coded integer
values for the major and minor values.  The FI_MAJOR_VERSION and FI_MINOR_VERSION
enum values defined in fabric.h specify the latest version of the installed
library.  However, it is recommended that the integer values for FI_MAJOR_VERSION
and FI_MINOR_VERSION be used, rather than referencing the enum types in order
to ensure compatibiliy with future versions of the library.  This protects
against the application being built from source against a newer version of the
library that introduces new fields to data structures, which would not be
initialized by the application.
.PP
Either node, service, or hints must be provided.  If hints are provided, the
operation will be controlled by hints.ai_flags.  If FI_PASSIVE is
specified, the call will resolve address information for use on the
passive side of a connection.
If node is provided, fi_getinfo will attempt to resolve the fabric address
to the given node.  The hints parameter, if provided,
may be used to control the resulting output as indicated below.
If node is not given, fi_getinfo will attempt to resolve the fabric addressing
information based on the provided hints.
.PP
The caller must call fi_freeinfo to release fi_info structures returned
by this call.
.SH "FI_INFO"

References a specific connection request, otherwise the field must be
NULL.  This field is used when processing connection requests and
responses.  See fi_eq(3), fi_reject(3), and fi_endpoint(3).
.IP "ep_attr"
Optionally supplied endpoint attributes.
Endpoint attributes may be specified and returned as part of fi_getinfo.
When provided as hints, requested values of struct fi_ep_attr should be
set.  On output, the actual endpoint attributes
that can be provided will be returned.  Output values will be greater than
or equal to requested input values.
See fi_endpoint(3) for details.
.IP "domain_attr"
Optionally supplied domain attributes.
Domain attributes may be specified and returned as part of fi_getinfo.

When provided as hints, requested values of struct fi_fabric_attr should be
set.  On output, the actual fabric attributes
that can be provided will be returned.
See fi_fabric(3) for details.
.SH "ENDPOINT CAPABILITIES"
Endpoint capabilities are obtained by OR-ing the following flags together.
If endpoint capabilities in the hint parameter are set to 0, the underlying
provider will return the set of capabilities which are supported.  Otherwise,
providers will only return endpoints matching the specified set of
capabilities.  Providers may indicate that an endpoint supports capabilities
beyond those requested when the use of expanded capabilities will not
adversely affect performance.  Applications may use this feature to request a
minimal set of requirements, then check the returned capabilities to enable
additional optimizations.
.IP "FI_PASSIVE"
Indicates that the fabric endpoint will be used to listen for connection
requests.  Use of this capability implies the use of the fi_getinfo flag
FI_SOURCE. 
.IP "FI_MSG"
Specifies that an endpoint should support sending and receiving
messages or datagrams.  Message capabilities imply support for send and/or
receive queues.  Endpoints supporting this capability support operations
defined by struct fi_ops_msg.
.sp
The ep_cap may be used to specify or restrict the type of messaging
operations that are supported.  In the absence of any relevant flags,
FI_MSG implies the ability to send and receive messages.
Applications can use the FI_SEND and FI_RECV flags to optimize an endpoint
as send-only or receive-only.
.IP "FI_RMA"
Specifies that the endpoint should support RMA read and write
operations.  Endpoints supporting this capability support operations
defined by struct fi_rma_ops.  In the absence of any relevant flags,
FI_RMA implies the ability to initiate and be the target of
remote memory reads and writes.  Applications can use the FI_READ, FI_WRITE,
FI_REMOTE_READ, and FI_REMOTE_WRITE flags to restrict the types of RMA
operations supported by an endpoint.
.IP "FI_TAGGED"
Specifies that the endpoint should handle tagged message transfers.
tagged message transfers associate a user-specified key or tag with each message
that is used for matching purposes at the remote side.  Endpoints supporting
this capability support operations defined by struct fi_tagged_ops.
In the absence of any relevant flags, FI_TAGGED implies the ability
to send and receive tagged messages.  Applications can use the FI_SEND and
FI_RECV flags to optimize an endpoint as send-only or receive-only.
.IP "FI_ATOMICS"
Specifies that the endpoint supports some set of atomic operations.
Endpoints supporting this capability support operations defined by struct
fi_atomic_ops.  In the absence of any relevant flags, FI_ATOMICS
implies the ability to initiate and be the target of
remote atomic reads and writes.  Applications can use the FI_READ, FI_WRITE,
FI_REMOTE_READ, and FI_REMOTE_WRITE flags to restrict the types of
atomic operations supported by an endpoint.
.IP "FI_MULTICAST"
Indicates that the endpoint should support multicast data transfers.
Endpoints supporting this capability support multicast operations defined by
struct fi_msg_ops, when a multicast address is specified as the destination
address.  In the absence of any relevant flags, FI_MULTICAST implies
the ability to send and receive messages.  Applications can use the FI_SEND and
FI_RECV flags to optimize an endpoint as send-only or receive-only.
.IP "FI_TRIGGER"
Indicates that the endpoint should support triggered operations.  Endpoints
support this capability must meet the usage model as described by
fi_trigger.3. 
.IP "FI_NAMED_RX_CTX"
Requests that endpoints which support multiple receive contexts allow an
initiator to target (or name) a specific receive context as part of a data
transfer operation.  
.IP "FI_BUFFERED_RECV"
Requests that the communication endpoint should attempt to queue
inbound data that arrives before a receive buffer has been posted.  In the
absence of this flag, any messages that arrive before a receive is
posted are lost.  Applications may access endpoint options (getopt/setopt)
to determine the size of available buffered receive space.
.IP "FI_INJECT"
Indicates that the endpoint be able to support the FI_INJECT flag on
data transfer operations and the 'inject' data transfer calls.  The
minimum supported size of an inject operation that an endpoint 
with this capability must support is 8-bytes.  Applications may access
endpoint options (getopt/setopt) to determine injected transfer limits.
.IP "FI_MULTI_RECV"
Specifies that the endpoint must support the FI_MULTI_RECV flag when
posting receive buffers.
.IP "FI_SOURCE"
Requests that the endpoint return source addressing data as part of its
completion data.  This capability only applies to connectionless endpoints.
Note that returning source
address information may require that the provider perform address
translation  and/or look-up based on data available in the underlying protocol
in order to provide the requested data, which may adversely affect performance.
.IP "FI_READ"
Indicates that the user requires an endpoint capable of initiating reads
against remote memory regions.  Remote reads include some RMA and atomic
operations.
.IP "FI_WRITE"
Indicates that the user requires an endpoint capable of initiating writes
against remote memory regions.  Remote writes include some RMA and most
atomic operations.
.IP "FI_SEND"
Indicates that the user requires an endpoint capable of sending message data
transfers.  Message transfers include base message operations as well as
tagged message functionality.
.IP "FI_RECV"
Indicates that the user requires an endpoint capable of receiving message
data transfers.  Message transfers include base message operations as well
as tagged message functionality.
.IP "FI_REMOTE_READ"
Indicates that the user requires an endpoint capable of receiving read memory
operations from remote endpoints.  Remote read operations include some RMA
and atomic operations.
.IP "FI_REMOTE_WRITE"
Indicates that the user requires an endpoint capable of receiving write memory
operations from remote endpoints.  Remote write operations include some RMA
operations and most atomic operations.
.IP "FI_REMOTE_EQ_DATA"
Applications may include a small message with a data transfer that is
placed directly into a remote event queue as part of a completion event.
This is referred to as remote EQ data (sometimes referred to as immediate data).
The FI_REMOTE_EQ_DATA indicates that an endpoint must support the
FI_REMOTE_EQ_DATA flag on data transfer operations.  The minimum supported size
of remote EQ data that an endpoint with this capability must support
is 4-bytes.  Applications may access endpoint options (getopt/setopt)
to determine remote EQ data limits.
.IP "FI_REMOTE_SIGNAL"
Indicates that the endpoint support the FI_REMOTE_SIGNAL flag on
data transfer operations.  Support requires marking outbound data
transfers as signaled and handling incoming transfers appropriately. 
.IP "FI_REMOTE_COMPLETE"
Indicates that the endpoint support the FI_REMOTE_COMPLETE flag on
data transfer operations.  Support requires marking outbound data
transfers as using remote completions and responding to incoming transfers
appropriately.
.IP "FI_CANCEL"
Indicates that the user desires the ability to cancel outstanding data
transfer operations.  If FI_CANCEL is not set, a provider may optimize code
paths with the assumption that fi_cancel will not be used by the application.
.SH "OP FLAGS"
Operation flags are obtained by OR-ing the following flags together.
Operation flags define the default flags applied to an endpoint's data
transfer operations, where a flags parameter is not available.  Data transfer
operations that take flags as input override the op_flags value of an
endpoint.
.IP "FI_INJECT"
If set, all data buffers used with outbound transfers return to the user's
control immediately after the call returns.  This is true even if the
operation is handled asynchronously.  This may require that the communication
interface implementation copy the data into a local buffer or inject the data
directly into the outbound transfer queue.
.IP "FI_MULTI_RECV"
Applies to posted receive operations.  This flag allows the user to post a
single buffer that will receive multiple incoming messages.  Received
messages will be packed into the receive buffer until the buffer has been
consumed.  Use of this flag may cause a single posted receive operation
to generate multiple events as messages are placed into the buffer.
The placement of received data into the buffer may be subjected to
provider specific alignment restrictions.  The buffer will be freed from
the endpoint when a message is received that cannot fit into the remaining
free buffer space.
.IP "FI_EVENT"
Indicates that a completion entry should be generated for data transfer
operations.
.IP "FI_REMOTE_SIGNAL"
Indicates that a completion event at the target process should be generated
for the given operation.  The remote endpoint must be configured with
FI_REMOTE_SIGNAL, or this flag will be ignored by the target.  The local
endpoint must be configured with the FI_REMOTE_SIGNAL capability in order
to specify this flag.
.IP "FI_REMOTE_COMPLETE"
Indicates that a completion should not be generated for a data transfer
operation until the operation has completed on the remote side.  The remote
endpoint must be configured with FI_REMOTE_COMPLETE for correct operation.
The local endpoint must be configured with the FI_REMOTE_COMPLETE capability
in order to specify this flag.
.SH "DOMAIN CAPABILITIES"
Domain capabilities are often used as output information from fi_getinfo,
allowing applications to adjust their behavior based on the provider's
hardware or software abilities.  However,specific capabilities may be
requested through the hints parameter, with the actual supported capabilities
returned by the provider.  Applications must check domain capabilities to
ensure that all provider requirements for using resources associated with
the access domain are met.
.IP "FI_WRITE_COHERENT"
Specifies that remote writes, including atomic operations, to the underlying
fabric domain are coherent with the local processing domain.  Domain-level
write coherency indicates that changes to local memory are visible to the
local process immediately upon completion of a remote write operation.  The
absence of this flag allows the NIC or memory subsystem to cache the results
of remote write or atomic operations in non-coherent memory.
.sp
The behavior of a domain with and without FI_WRITE_COHERENT is illustrated
below.
.nf

      Process 1            Process 2
                           Register BUF
      RMA write X to BUF
      Notify process 2
                           Receive notification
                           if not FI_WRITE_COHERENT
                                Sync with remote writes
                           assert(BUF == X)

.fi
.sp
This flag may be set on input hints to fi_getinfo if write coherency is
required by an application.  If left unset, the pro  See the endpoint
fi_ep_sync call for handling non-coherent writes.
.IP "FI_CONTEXT"
Specifies that the provider requires that applications use struct fi_context
as their per operation context parameter.  This structure should be treated as
opaque to the application.  For performance reasons, this structure must be
allocated by the user, but may be used by the fabric provider to track the
operation.  Typically, users embed struct fi_context within their own
context structure.  The struct fi_context must remain valid until the
corresponding operation completes or is successfully canceled.  As such,
fi_context should NOT be allocated on the stack.  Doing so is likely to
result in stack corruption that will be difficult to debug.  Users should
not update or interpret the fields in this structure, or reuse it until
the original operation has completed.  The structure is
specified in rdma/fabric.h.
.IP "FI_LOCAL_MR"
The provider is optimized around having applications register memory
for locally accessed data buffers.  Data buffers used in send and receive
operations and as the source buffer for RMA and atomic operations must be
registered by the application for access domains opened with this capability.
.IP "FI_USER_MR_KEY"
The provider supports user requested memory registration keys.  Providers
that set this capability honor the requested_key parameter for memory
registration calls.
.IP "FI_DYNAMIC_MR"
The provider supports applications registering any range of addresses
in their virtual address space, whether or not those addresses are
back by physical pages or have been allocated to the app.
Providers that lack this capability require that registered memory
regions be backed by allocated memory pages.
.SH "ENDPOINT TYPES"
.IP "FI_EP_UNSPEC"
The type of endpoint is not specified.  This is usually provided as input, with
other attributes of the endpoint or the provider selecting the type.
.IP "FI_EP_MSG"
Provides a reliable, connection-oriented data transfer service with flow
control that maintains message boundaries.
.IP "FI_EP_DGRAM"
Supports a connectionless, unreliable datagram communication.  Message
boundaries are maintained, but the maximum message size may be limited to
the fabric MTU.  Flow control is not guaranteed.
.IP "FI_EP_RDM"
Reliable datagram message.  Provides a reliable, unconnected data transfer
service with flow control that maintains message boundaries.
.SH "ADDRESSING FORMATS"
Multiple fabric interfaces take as input either a source or destination
address parameter.  This includes struct fi_info (src_addr and dest_addr),
CM calls (getname, getpeer, connect, join, and leave), and AV calls (insert,
lookup, and straddr).  The fi_info addr_format field indicates the expected
address format for these operations.
.PP
A provider may support one or more of the following addressing formats.  In
some cases, a selected addressing format may need to be translated or mapped
into into an address which is native to the fabric.
.BR "fi_av(3)".
.IP "FI_ADDR_PROTO"
FI_ADDR_PROTO indicates that a native, protocol specific address format should
be used.  Protocol specific addresses are intended to be treated as opaque
by applications, and they target apps which make use of an out of band
address exchange.
Applications which use FI_ADDR_PROTO may use fi_getname() to obtain the
protocol specific address assigned to an allocated endpoint.
.IP "FI_SOCKADDR"
Address is of type sockaddr.  The specific socket address format will be
determined at run time by interfaces examining the sa_family field.
.IP "FI_SOCKADDR_IN"
Address is of type sockaddr_in (IPv4).
.IP "FI_SOCKADDR_IN6"
Address is of type sockaddr_in6 (IPv6).
.IP "FI_SOCKADDR_IB"
Address is of type sockaddr_ib (defined in Linux kernel source 
.BR "include/rdma/ib.h").
.SH "FLAGS"
The operation of the fi_getinfo call may be controlled through the use of
input flags.  Valid flags include the following.
.IP "FI_NUMERICHOST"
Indicates that the node parameter is a numeric string representation of a
fabric address, such as a dotted decimal IP address.  Use of this flag will
suppress any lengthy name resolution protocol.
.IP "FI_SOURCE"
Indicates that the node and service parameters specify the local source
address to associate with an endpoint.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns 0 on success. On error, a negative value corresponding to fabric
errno is returned. Fabric errno values are defined in 
.IR "rdma/fi_errno.h".
.SH "ERRORS"
.IP "FI_EBADFLAGS"
The specified endpoint or domain capability or operation flags are invalid. 
.IP "FI_ENOMEM"
Indicates that there was insufficient memory to complete the operation.
.IP "FI_ENODATA"
Indicates that no providers could be found which support the requested
fabric information.
.IP "FI_ENOSYS"
No fabric providers were found.
.SH "NOTES"
If hints are provided, the
operation will be controlled by the values that are supplied in the various
fields (see section on
.IR "fi_info").
Applications that require specific communication interfaces, domains,
capabilities or other requirements, can specify them using fields in
.IR "hints".
Libfabric returns a linked list in
.I info
that points to a list of matching interfaces.  
.I info 
is set to NULL if there are no communication interfaces or none match
the input hints.
.PP
If node is provided, fi_getinfo will attempt to resolve the fabric address
to the given node.  If node is not provided, fi_getinfo will attempt to resolve
the fabric addressing information based on the provided hints.  The caller must
call fi_freeinfo to release fi_info structures returned by fi_getinfo.
.PP
If neither node, service or hints are provided, then fi_getinfo simply returns
the list all available communication interfaces.
.PP
Multiple threads may call 
.BR fi_getinfo " simultaneously, without any requirement for serialization."
