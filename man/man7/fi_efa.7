fi_efa - The Amazon Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) Provider
.SH OVERVIEW
.PP
The EFA provider supports the Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) device on
Amazon EC2.
EFA provides reliable and unreliable datagram send/receive with direct
hardware access from userspace (OS bypass).
For reliable datagram (RDM) EP type, it supports two fabric names:
\f[V]efa\f[R] and \f[V]efa-direct\f[R].
The \f[V]efa\f[R] fabric implements a set of wire protocols to support
more capabilities and features beyond the EFA device capabilities.
The \f[V]efa-direct\f[R] fabric, on the contrary, offloads all libfabric
data plane calls to the device directly without wire protocols.
Compared to the \f[V]efa\f[R] fabric, the \f[V]efa-direct\f[R] fabric
supports fewer capabilities and has more mode requirements for
applications.
But it provides a fast path to hand off application requests to the
device.
More details and difference between the two fabrics will be presented
below.
.SH SUPPORTED FEATURES
.PP
The following features are supported:
.TP
\f[I]Endpoint types\f[R]
The provider supports endpoint type \f[I]FI_EP_DGRAM\f[R], and
\f[I]FI_EP_RDM\f[R] on a new Scalable (unordered) Reliable Datagram
protocol (SRD).
SRD provides support for reliable datagrams and more complete error
handling than typically seen with other Reliable Datagram (RD)
implementations.
.TP
\f[I]RDM Endpoint capabilities\f[R]
For the \f[V]efa\f[R] fabric, the following data transfer interfaces are
supported: \f[I]FI_MSG\f[R], \f[I]FI_TAGGED\f[R], \f[I]FI_SEND\f[R],
\f[I]FI_RECV\f[R], \f[I]FI_RMA\f[R], \f[I]FI_WRITE\f[R],
\f[I]FI_READ\f[R], \f[I]FI_ATOMIC\f[R], \f[I]FI_DIRECTED_RECV\f[R],
\f[I]FI_MULTI_RECV\f[R], and \f[I]FI_SOURCE\f[R].
It provides SAS guarantees for data operations, and does not have a
maximum message size (for all operations).
For the \f[V]efa-direct\f[R] fabric, it supports \f[I]FI_MSG\f[R],
\f[I]FI_SEND\f[R], \f[I]FI_RECV\f[R], \f[I]FI_RMA\f[R],
\f[I]FI_WRITE\f[R], \f[I]FI_READ\f[R], and \f[I]FI_SOURCE\f[R].
As mentioned earlier, it doesn\[cq]t provide SAS guarantees, and has
different maximum message sizes for different operations.
For MSG operations, the maximum message size is the MTU size of the efa
device (approximately 8KiB).
For RMA operations, the maximum message size is the maximum RDMA size of
the EFA device.
The exact values of these sizes can be queried by the
\f[V]fi_getopt\f[R] API with option names \f[V]FI_OPT_MAX_MSG_SIZE\f[R]
and \f[V]FI_OPT_MAX_RMA_SIZE\f[R]
.TP
\f[I]DGRAM Endpoint capabilities\f[R]
The DGRAM endpoint only supports \f[I]FI_MSG\f[R] capability with a
maximum message size of the MTU of the underlying hardware
(approximately 8 KiB).
.TP
\f[I]Address vectors\f[R]
The provider supports \f[I]FI_AV_TABLE\f[R].
\f[I]FI_AV_MAP\f[R] was deprecated in Libfabric 2.x.
Applications can still use \f[I]FI_AV_MAP\f[R] to create an address
vector.
But the EFA provider implementation will print a warning and switch to
\f[I]FI_AV_TABLE\f[R].
\f[I]FI_EVENT\f[R] is unsupported.
.TP
\f[I]Completion events\f[R]
The provider supports \f[I]FI_CQ_FORMAT_CONTEXT\f[R],
\f[I]FI_CQ_FORMAT_MSG\f[R], and \f[I]FI_CQ_FORMAT_DATA\f[R].
\f[I]FI_CQ_FORMAT_TAGGED\f[R] is supported on the \f[V]efa\f[R] fabric
of RDM endpoint.
Wait objects are not currently supported.
.TP
\f[I]Modes\f[R]
The provider requires the use of \f[I]FI_MSG_PREFIX\f[R] when running
over the DGRAM endpoint.
And it requires the use of \f[I]FI_CONTEXT2\f[R] mode for DGRAM endpoint
and the \f[V]efa-direct\f[R] fabric of RDM endpoint.
The \f[V]efa\f[R] fabric of RDM endpoint doesn\[cq]t have these
requirements.
.TP
\f[I]Memory registration modes\f[R]
The \f[V]efa\f[R] fabric of RDM endpoint does not require memory
registration for send and receive operations, i.e.\ it does not require
\f[I]FI_MR_LOCAL\f[R].
Applications may specify \f[I]FI_MR_LOCAL\f[R] in the MR mode flags in
order to use descriptors provided by the application.
The \f[V]efa-direct\f[R] fabric of \f[I]FI_EP_RDM\f[R] endpint and the
\f[I]FI_EP_DGRAM\f[R] endpoint only supports \f[I]FI_MR_LOCAL\f[R].
.TP
\f[I]Progress\f[R]
RDM and DGRAM endpoints support \f[I]FI_PROGRESS_MANUAL\f[R].
EFA erroneously claims the support for \f[I]FI_PROGRESS_AUTO\f[R],
despite not properly supporting automatic progress.
Unfortunately, some Libfabric consumers also ask for
\f[I]FI_PROGRESS_AUTO\f[R] when they only require
\f[I]FI_PROGRESS_MANUAL\f[R], and fixing this bug would break those
applications.
This will be fixed in a future version of the EFA provider by adding
proper support for \f[I]FI_PROGRESS_AUTO\f[R].
.TP
\f[I]Threading\f[R]
Both RDM and DGRAM endpoints supports \f[I]FI_THREAD_SAFE\f[R].
.SH LIMITATIONS
.SS Completion events
.IP \[bu] 2
Synchronous CQ read is not supported.
.IP \[bu] 2
Wait objects are not currently supported.
.SS RMA operations
.IP \[bu] 2
Completion events for RMA targets (\f[I]FI_RMA_EVENT\f[R]) is not
supported.
.IP \[bu] 2
For the \f[V]efa-direct\f[R] fabric, the target side of RMA operation
must insert the initiator side\[cq]s address into AV before the RMA
operation is kicked off, due to a current device limitation.
The same limitation applies to the \f[V]efa\f[R] fabric when the
\f[V]FI_OPT_EFA_HOMOGENEOUS_PEERS\f[R] option is set as \f[V]true\f[R].
.SS Zero-copy receive mode
.IP \[bu] 2
Zero-copy receive mode can be enabled only if SHM transfer is disabled.
.IP \[bu] 2
Unless the application explicitly disables P2P, e.g.\ via
FI_HMEM_P2P_DISABLED, zero-copy receive can be enabled only if available
FI_HMEM devices all have P2P support.
.SS \f[V]fi_cancel\f[R] support
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]fi_cancel\f[R] is only supported in the non-zero-copy-receive mode
of the \f[V]efa\f[R] fabric.
It\[cq]s not supported in \f[V]efa-direct\f[R], DGRAM endpoint, and the
zero-copy receive mode of the \f[V]efa\f[R] fabric in RDM endpoint.
.PP
When using FI_HMEM for AWS Neuron or Habana SynapseAI buffers, the
provider requires peer to peer transaction support between the EFA and
the FI_HMEM device.
Therefore, the FI_HMEM_P2P_DISABLED option is not supported by the EFA
provider for AWS Neuron or Habana SynapseAI.
.SH PROVIDER SPECIFIC ENDPOINT LEVEL OPTION
.TP
\f[I]FI_OPT_EFA_RNR_RETRY\f[R]
Defines the number of RNR retry.
The application can use it to reset RNR retry counter via the call to
fi_setopt.
Note that this option must be set before the endpoint is enabled.
Otherwise, the call will fail.
Also note that this option only applies to RDM endpoint.
.TP
\f[I]FI_OPT_EFA_EMULATED_READ, FI_OPT_EFA_EMULATED_WRITE, FI_OPT_EFA_EMULATED_ATOMICS - bool\f[R]
These options only apply to the fi_getopt() call.
They are used to query the EFA provider to determine if the endpoint is
emulating Read, Write, and Atomic operations (return value is true), or
if these operations are assisted by hardware support (return value is
false).
.TP
\f[I]FI_OPT_EFA_USE_DEVICE_RDMA - bool\f[R]
This option only applies to the fi_setopt() call.
Only available if the application selects a libfabric API version >=
1.18.
This option allows an application to change libfabric\[cq]s behavior
with respect to RDMA transfers.
Note that there is also an environment variable FI_EFA_USE_DEVICE_RDMA
which the user may set as well.
If the environment variable and the argument provided with this variable
are in conflict, then fi_setopt will return -FI_EINVAL, and the
environment variable will be respected.
If the hardware does not support RDMA and the argument is true, then
fi_setopt will return -FI_EOPNOTSUPP.
If the application uses API version < 1.18, the argument is ignored and
fi_setopt returns -FI_ENOPROTOOPT.
The default behavior for RDMA transfers depends on API version.
For API >= 1.18 RDMA is enabled by default on any hardware which
supports it.
For API<1.18, RDMA is enabled by default only on certain newer hardware
revisions.
.TP
\f[I]FI_OPT_EFA_SENDRECV_IN_ORDER_ALIGNED_128_BYTES - bool\f[R]
This option only applies to the fi_setopt() call.
It is used to force the endpoint to use in-order send/recv operation for
each 128 bytes aligned block.
Enabling the option will guarantee data inside each 128 bytes aligned
block being sent and received in order, it will also guarantee data to
be delivered to the receive buffer only once.
If endpoint is not able to support this feature, it will return
-FI_EOPNOTSUPP for the call to fi_setopt().
.TP
\f[I]FI_OPT_EFA_WRITE_IN_ORDER_ALIGNED_128_BYTES - bool\f[R]
This option only applies to the fi_setopt() call.
It is used to set the endpoint to use in-order RDMA write operation for
each 128 bytes aligned block.
Enabling the option will guarantee data inside each 128 bytes aligned
block being written in order, it will also guarantee data to be
delivered to the target buffer only once.
If endpoint is not able to support this feature, it will return
-FI_EOPNOTSUPP for the call to fi_setopt().
.TP
\f[I]FI_OPT_EFA_HOMOGENEOUS_PEERS - bool\f[R]
This option only applies to the fi_setopt() call for RDM endpoints on
efa fabric.
RDM endpoints on efa-direct fabric are unaffected by this option.
When set to true, it indicates all peers are homogeneous, meaning they
run on the same platform, use the same software versions, and share
identical capabilities.
It accelerates the initial communication setup as interoperability
between peers is guaranteed.
When set to true, the target side of a RMA operation must insert the
initiator side\[cq]s address into AV before the RMA operation is kicked
off, due to a current device limitation.
The default value is false.
.SH PROVIDER SPECIFIC DOMAIN OPS
.PP
The efa provider exports extensions for operations that are not provided
by the standard libfabric interface.
These extensions are available via the \[lq]\f[V]fi_ext_efa.h\f[R]\[rq]

.TP
\f[I]FI_EFA_FORK_SAFE\f[R]
Enable fork() support.
This may have a small performance impact and should only be set when
required.
Applications that require to register regions backed by huge pages and
also require fork support are not supported.
.TP
\f[I]FI_EFA_RUNT_SIZE\f[R]

If instance support RDMA read, messages whose size is larger than this
value will be sent by read message protocol.
(Default 1048576).
.TP
\f[I]FI_EFA_INTER_MIN_READ_WRITE_SIZE\f[R]
The mimimum message size for emulated inter EFA write to use read write
protocol.
If firmware support RDMA read, and FI_EFA_USE_DEVICE_RDMA is 1, write
requests whose size is larger than this value will use the read write
protocol (Default 65536).
If the firmware supports RDMA write, device RDMA write will always be
used.
.TP
\f[I]FI_EFA_USE_DEVICE_RDMA\f[R]
Specify whether to require or ignore RDMA features of the EFA device.
- When set to 1/true/yes/on, all RDMA features of the EFA device are
used.
But if EFA device does not support RDMA and FI_EFA_USE_DEVICE_RDMA is
set to 1/true/yes/on, user\[cq]s application is aborted and a warning
message is printed.
- When set to 0/false/no/off, libfabric will emulate all fi_rma
operations instead of offloading them to the EFA network device.
Libfabric will not use device RDMA to implement send/receive operations.
- If not set, RDMA operations will occur when available based on RDMA
device ID/version.
.TP
\f[I]FI_EFA_USE_HUGE_PAGE\f[R]
Specify Whether EFA provider can use huge page memory for internal
buffer.
