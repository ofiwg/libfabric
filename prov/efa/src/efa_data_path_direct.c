/**
 * @file efa_data_path_direct.c
 * @brief EFA Direct Data Path Implementation
 *
 * This file implements the core functionality for EFA's direct data path
 * operations. It provides the initialization, configuration, and
 * cleanup functions for direct hardware access to completion queues and
 * queue pairs.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Direct hardware queue pair initialization and configuration
 * - Completion queue setup for direct hardware access
 * - Integration with rdma-core's efadv query interfaces
 * - Memory management for work request tracking structures
 *
 * The implementation leverages rdma-core's efadv (EFA device-specific)
 * interfaces to query hardware queue attributes and map hardware buffers
 * for direct access. This bypasses the standard libfabric completion
 * processing path to provide optimized performance for latency-sensitive
 * applications.
 *
 * Functions in this file are called during:
 * - Queue pair creation (efa_data_path_direct_qp_initialize)
 * - Completion queue creation (efa_data_path_direct_cq_initialize)
 * - Resource cleanup (efa_data_path_direct_qp_finalize)
